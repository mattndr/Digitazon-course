                        <b>Barbara Liskov</b> (born November 7, 1939 as <b>Barbara Jane Huberman</b>) is an American
                        computer
                        scientist
                        who
                        has made pioneering contributions to programming languages and distributed computing. Her
                        notable work
                        includes the development of the Liskov substitution principle which describes the fundamental
                        nature of
                        data abstraction, and is used in type theory (see subtyping) and in object-oriented programming
                        (see
                        inheritance). Her work was recognized with the 2008 Turing Award, the highest distinction in
                        computer
                        science.

                    <p>
                        Liskov is one of the earliest women to have been granted a doctorate in computer science in the
                        United
                        States, and the second woman to receive the Turing award. She is currently an Institute
                        Professor and
                        Ford Professor of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

                    <p>
                        Liskov was born November 7, 1939, in Los Angeles, California,[4] to a Jewish family, the eldest
                        of Jane
                        (née Dickhoff) and Moses Huberman's four children.[5] She earned her bachelor's degree in
                        mathematics
                        with a minor in physics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1961. At Berkeley, she had
                        only one
                        other female classmate in her major.[6] She applied to graduate mathematics programs at Berkeley
                        and
                        Princeton. At the time Princeton was not accepting female students in mathematics.[7] She was
                        accepted
                        at Berkeley but instead moved to Boston and began working at Mitre Corporation, where she became
                        interested in computers and programming. She worked at Mitre for one year before taking a
                        programming
                        job at Harvard working on language translation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She then decided to go back to school and applied again to Berkeley, but also to Stanford and
                        Harvard.
                        In March 1968 she became one of the first women in the United States to be awarded a Ph.D. from
                        a
                        computer science department when she was awarded her degree from Stanford University.[8][9][10]
                        At
                        Stanford, she worked with John McCarthy and was supported to work in artificial intelligence.[7]
                        The
                        topic of her Ph.D. thesis was a computer program to play chess endgames for which she developed
                        the
                        important killer heuristic.

                    <p>
                        After graduating from Stanford, Liskov returned to Mitre to work as research staff.[2]

                    <p>
                        Liskov has led many significant projects, including the Venus operating system, a small,
                        low-cost
                        timesharing system; the design and implementation of CLU; Argus, the first high-level language
                        to
                        support implementation of distributed programs and to demonstrate the technique of promise
                        pipelining;
                        and Thor, an object-oriented database system. With Jeannette Wing, she developed a particular
                        definition
                        of subtyping, commonly known as the Liskov substitution principle. She leads the Programming
                        Methodology
                        Group at MIT, with a current research focus in Byzantine fault tolerance and distributed
                        computing.[3]
                        She was on the inaugural Engineering and Computer Science jury for the Infosys Prize in
                        2009.[12]

                Liskov is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow
                of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). In
                2002, she was recognized as one of the top women faculty members at MIT, and among the top 50 faculty
                members in the sciences in the U.S.[13] In 2002, Discover magazine recognized Liskov as one of the 50
                most important women in science.[14]
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2004, Barbara Liskov won the John von Neumann Medal for "fundamental contributions to programming
                languages, programming methodology, and distributed systems".[15] On 19 November 2005, Barbara Liskov
                and Donald E. Knuth were awarded ETH Honorary Doctorates.[16] Liskov and Knuth were also featured in the
                ETH Zurich Distinguished Colloquium Series.[17] She was awarded a Doctorate Honoris Causa by the
                University of Lugano in 2011[18] and by Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in 2018.[19]
            </p>
            <p>
                Liskov received the 2008 Turing Award from the ACM in March 2009,[20] for her work in the design of
                programming languages and software methodology that led to the development of object-oriented
                programming.[21] Specifically, Liskov developed two programming languages, CLU[22] in the 1970s and
                Argus[23] in the 1980s.[21] The ACM cited her contributions to the practical and theoretical foundations
                of "programming language and system design, especially related to data abstraction, fault tolerance, and
                distributed computing".[24] In 2012 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.[25]
